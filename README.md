2. **Supabase API URL** and **Anon Key**.  
3. Flutter SDK installed on your machine.  

## Setup Instructions

### 3. Configure Supabase  
- Open the Supabase dashboard.  
- Go to **Settings > API** and copy your projectâ€™s **API URL** and **Anon Key**.  
- Replace placeholders in your `lib/main.dart` (or similar configuration file):  

```dart  
void main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  await Supabase.initialize(
    url: "PROJECT URL",
    anonKey: "ANON KEY",
  );
  runApp(const MyApp());
}
